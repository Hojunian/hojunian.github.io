I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Robot Learning Laboratory (RLLAB)](https://rllab.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, South Korea. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning algorithms, with the goal of enabling autonomous agents to perform complex tasks. Recently, I have been focusing on training robust agent policies through reinforcement learning and unsupervised environment design.

**Research Interests**: Robot Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised Environment Desitn, Generative Simulation
